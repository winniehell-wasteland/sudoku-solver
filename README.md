This program solves sudokus with a branch-and-bound like approach.
It was a homework assignment of
[Algorithm Engineering](http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/courses/ss11/ae/).
The initial files (sudoku5.cpp, testset_sudokus.cpp) are written by 
[Prof. Dr. Alexander Kr√∂ller](http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/kroeller/)
as part of the assignment and I hope that I have his permission
to publish them along with the other files as the program would
not run without them. Feel free to do whatever you like with the
rest of the files but don't blame me if it breaks anything.
